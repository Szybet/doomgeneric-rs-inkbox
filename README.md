### Doom working on a kobo nia, I'm suprised no one did it before me on any kobo
The video is `doom.mp4`, and here a youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-FgfQZEUM

This is a evening project, fun to make but the code is crap and I didn't cared to make it better because even with forcing A2 on eink and hardware dithering it won't be better
### This is a half joke, I'm just proving a point.
